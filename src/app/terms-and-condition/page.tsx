          The details of the products or product specifications (for instance
          weight, color, handwork details, size, etc.) quoted with the product
          displays are only fairly approximate values. While every endeavor has
          been made to accurately reproduce colors, there may be minor
          variations in color of the actual product because of the nature of
          product, weather at the time of differences in display output due to
          lighting and digital photography and color settings and capabilities
          of monitors. A customer must place an order keeping in mind this minor
          variation in color as seen on a computer screen against the actual
          color of the product received. www.whpjewellers.com believes that all
          online buyers are aware that colors seen on a monitor will be slightly
          different as compared to the actual product or accessories ordered and
          all customers who order products online are aware of the fact.
